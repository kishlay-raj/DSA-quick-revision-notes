The most efficient way to count inversions is by using a modified merge sort algorithm.<br><br>## Steps to Solve the Problem<br><br>1. **Divide and Conquer**: Use the merge sort technique to divide the array into two halves recursively until each half contains a single element.<br>2. **Count Inversions During Merge**: While merging two halves, count how many times elements from the right half are less than elements from the left half. Each time this occurs, it indicates that all remaining elements in the left half will also form inversions with that element from the right half.<br>3. **Combine Counts**: The total number of inversions is the sum of inversions found in the left half, right half, and during the merging process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                   |            |                 |

Finally, calculate the median based on whether the total number of elements is even or odd, using the maximum of the left sides and the minimum of the right sides.<br>**While doing the first partition, we split smaller array in half and they bigger one, size of both minus size of small one to keep it balanced and to be at middle**.<br>Keep shifting the smaller array left right, and check with the bigger array new left right calculated using smaller one's new left right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                   |            |                 |
| [Minimize Max Distance to Gas Station](https://takeuforward.org/arrays/minimise-maximum-distance-between-gas-stations/)<br>**Problem Statement:** You are given a sorted array ‘arr’ of length ‘n’, which contains positive integer positions of ‘n’ gas stations on the X-axis. You are also given an integer ‘k’. You have to place 'k' new gas stations on the X-axis. You can place them anywhere on the non-negative side of the X-axis, even on non-integer positions. Let 'dist' be the maximum value of the distance between adjacent gas stations after adding k new gas stations.  <br>Find the minimum value of ‘dist’.                                                                                                                                                       | To solve the **Minimize Max Distance to Gas Station** problem, use **binary search** to find the smallest possible maximum distance between gas stations. Define the search range as [0,max_distance][0, max\_distance][0,max_distance], where max_distancemax\_distancemax_distance is the maximum distance between two adjacent stations. For a given candidate maximum distance midmidmid, check if it is feasible by counting the additional stations needed to make all gaps ≤mid \leq mid≤mid. Adjust the search range based on feasibility: if feasible, reduce midmidmid; otherwise, increase it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                   |            |                 |

Move one pointer (`slow`) one step at a time and another pointer (`fast`) two steps at a time; when the `fast` pointer reaches the end, the `slow` pointer will be at the middle. This approach works in O(n)O(n)O(n) time with O(1)O(1)O(1) space, regardless of whether the list has an odd or even number of nodes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                   |            |                 |

If there is a loop, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer; if the fast pointer reaches the end of the list (null), then there is no loop. Once a loop is detected, you can find the starting point of the loop by resetting one pointer to the head of the list and moving both pointers one step at a time until they meet again                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                   |            |                 |

After that, move both pointers simultaneously until the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the list, at which point the `slow` pointer will be positioned just before the Nth node from the end, allowing you to adjust the pointers to remove that node                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                   |            |                 |

Start by initializing two pointers at the heads of both lists and traverse them until they either meet or both reach the end; if one pointer reaches the end, redirect it to the head of the other list. This way, both pointers will traverse the same total distance, allowing them to meet at the intersection point if one exists, or both will reach null if there is no intersection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                   |            |                 |

First, recursively split the linked list into two halves until you reach base cases of single nodes, then merge the sorted halves back together by comparing the values of the nodes. This approach maintains a time complexity of  and is stable, preserving the relative order of equal elements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                   |            |                 |

Traverse the original linked list, appending each node to either the odd list or the even list based on its value, and keep track of the last node in each list to facilitate easy linking. **Finally, connect the end of the odd list to the head of the even list and set the tail of the even list to `null` to complete the segregation.**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                   |            |                 |

Start with an empty subsequence and iterate through the string, making recursive calls to generate subsequences for both scenarios until you reach the end of the string. When you hit the base case (end of the string), print the current subsequence if it’s not empty, and backtrack to explore other combinations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                   |            |                 |

If placing a queen leads to a conflict, backtrack by removing the last placed queen and try the next possible position until all queens are successfully placed or all configurations have been exhausted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                   |            |                 |

The algorithm involves checking if placing a number in a cell is valid by ensuring it does not violate Sudoku rules (no duplicates in the same row, column, or 3x3 subgrid). If a number can be placed, the algorithm continues to the next empty cell; if it encounters a situation where no number can be placed, it backtracks by removing the last placed number and tries the next possibility until the entire board is filled correctly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                   |            |                 |

Begin by creating a recursive function that attempts to color each vertex starting from the first one, checking if the current color assignment is safe (i.e., it does not conflict with adjacent vertices). If a valid color is found, recursively attempt to color the next vertex; if all vertices are colored successfully, return true. If no valid color can be assigned to a vertex, backtrack by removing the last assigned color and trying the next available color until all possibilities are exhausted or a solution is found.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                   |            |                 |

Begin by iterating through each cell, and if the cell matches the first letter of the word, recursively check its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) for the subsequent letters while marking cells as visited to avoid reusing them. If you reach the end of the word successfully, return true; otherwise, backtrack by unmarking the visited cells and continue searching until all possibilities are exhausted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                   |            |                 |

| Next Greater Element<br>Given a circular integer array **A**, return the next greater element for every element in A. The next greater element for an element x is the first element greater than x that we come across while traversing the array in a clockwise manner. If it doesn't exist, return -1 for this element.<br>**Input:** N = 11, A[] = {3,10,4,2,1,2,6,1,7,2,9}<br><br>**Output:** 10,-1,6,6,2,6,7,7,9,9,10<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | To solve this, use a **monotonic decreasing stack** to track indices of elements for which the next greater element hasn’t been found yet. Traverse the array twice (simulate the circular behavior by treating indices modulo nnn), and for each element, check if it is greater than the element at the top of the stack; if so, update the result for the index at the top. Push the current index onto the stack if its next greater element hasn't been determined. This approach ensures O(n)O(n)O(n) time complexity by limiting each element's processing to at most twice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                   |            |                 |

The core concept is to simulate the collision process by using the stack to keep track of surviving asteroids after all possible collisions have been resolved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                   |            |                 |
| [Sliding Window maximum](https://takeuforward.org/data-structure/sliding-window-maximum/)<br> Given an array of integers arr, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

Second DFS Pass: From node `A`, perform another DFS to find the farthest node from `A`, which we will call `B`. The distance between `A` and `B` represents the diameter of the tree.<br>	3.

| [Maximum path sum](https://takeuforward.org/data-structure/maximum-sum-path-in-binary-tree/)<br><br>A **path** in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence **at most once**. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.<br><br>The **path sum** of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.<br><br>Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the maximum **path sum** of any **non-empty** path_.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | The key concept to solve the Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum problem involves understanding that a path can start and end at any node in the tree, and it can traverse through multiple nodes without needing to pass through the root. The main insight is to use a recursive Depth-First Search (DFS) approach to calculate the maximum path sums at each node by considering the contributions from both its left and right subtrees, while also keeping track of the overall maximum path sum encountered during the traversal.<br><br>Key Insights:<br>	1.	Path Definition: A path in the binary tree is defined as a sequence of nodes connected by edges, where each node can only appear once in that sequence. The path does not have to include the root of the tree.<br>	2.	Recursive Calculation: For each node, compute the maximum path sum that can be achieved by including that node and extending to either its left or right child. This involves:<br>	•	Calculating the maximum path sums from both left and right children.<br>	•	Ignoring negative contributions by using `max(0, left_sum)` and `max(0, right_sum)` to ensure that only positive values are added to the current node’s value.<br>	3.	Global Maximum Tracking: Maintain a global variable to update the maximum path sum found at any point in the tree, which is computed as `node.val + left + right` for each node.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                   |            |                 |

The key insights for this problem involve tracking the horizontal distance (HD) of each node from the root and ensuring that you capture the last node encountered at each horizontal distance, as this will represent the bottom view.<br><br>### Key Insights:<br><br>1. **Horizontal Distance (HD)**:<br>    <br>    - The concept of **horizontal distance (HD)** is crucial for determining which nodes belong to the same vertical line.<br>    - The root node has an HD of `0`.<br>    - For each left child, the HD is the parent's HD minus 1.<br>    - For each right child, the HD is the parent's HD plus 1.<br><br>**Bottom View Property**:<br><br>- For nodes that share the same **horizontal distance**, the **bottommost node** is the one that is visible.<br>- If multiple nodes have the same HD, the one encountered last in a **level-order traversal (BFS)** will be the bottommost node.<br><br>**Level Order Traversal (BFS)**:<br><br>- To ensure we capture the bottommost node at each horizontal distance, we use a **BFS (level-order traversal)**. This ensures that we visit the nodes from top to bottom, left to right.<br>- For each node, if its HD is not already recorded, we add it to the map. If it's already present, we update the value to the current node (this ensures the bottommost node is recorded).<br><br>**Use of a HashMap**:<br><br>- A **HashMap** is used to store the **HD** as the key and the node value as the value.<br>- As we traverse the tree, we continuously update the value for each HD, ensuring only the bottommost node (the last one encountered in BFS) is stored.<br><br>### Approach:<br><br>1. Perform a **Level-Order Traversal** (BFS) to explore nodes from top to bottom.<br>2. For each node, compute its **HD** and store it in a **HashMap**.<br>3. Once the traversal is done, extract the values from the **HashMap** in increasing order of the HD to get the **Bottom View**.<br><br>### Hint for the Code:<br><br>1. Use a **Queue** for BFS traversal. Each entry in the queue will store a pair of node and its corresponding HD.<br>2. Use a **HashMap<Integer, Integer>** where the key is the **HD** and the value is the node's value at that HD.<br>3. After BFS traversal, iterate over the keys of the map in sorted order to print the bottom view.                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                   |            |                 |

The traversal process uses a pointer to the left child when available, and otherwise moves to the right child                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                   |            |                 |

Repeat until you find the LCA.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                   |            |                 |

Perform a **postorder traversal** of the tree (left-right-root).<br>2. For each node, check the following:<br>    - If the left and right subtrees are valid BSTs.<br>    - Ensure the current node’s value is greater than the maximum value of the left subtree and less than the minimum value of the right subtree.<br>3. If the current subtree is a valid BST:<br>    - Calculate its size (size of left + size of right + 1 for the current node).<br>    - Update the largest BST size if the current subtree’s size is greater.<br>4. Return the largest BST size found. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                   |            |                 |
