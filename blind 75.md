Then, for each neighbor of the original node, ensure you clone it if it hasn't been cloned yet, and connect the cloned nodes accordingly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | make sure that you track the visited node                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                |                        |

Finally, verify that all nodes have been visited to ensure full connectivity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                |                        |

The solution involves a recursive DFS approach to calculate the maximum path sum passing through each node and keeping track of the global maximum.<br><br>### Key Steps:<br><br>1. For each node, compute the maximum sum of a path that includes the node and one of its subtrees (left or right).<br>2. Update the global maximum with the sum of the node's value and the maximum sums from both left and right subtrees (if applicable).<br>3. Return the maximum sum for each subtree path to its parent (only one subtree can be included in the return path).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | def max_path_sum(node):<br>    def helper(node):<br>        if not node:<br>            return 0<br>        left = max(helper(node.left), 0)  # ignore negative paths<br>        right = max(helper(node.right), 0)<br>        local_max = node.value + left + right  # max path through this node<br>        global_max[0] = max(global_max[0], local_max)<br>        return node.value + max(left, right)  # return max single path upwards<br><br>    global_max = [-float('inf')]<br>    helper(node)<br>    return global_max[0]<br> | - **Not Handling Negative Values**: Ensure that you correctly handle paths with negative sums by ignoring them when calculating maximum paths. Use `max(helper(node.left), 0)` to avoid adding negative contributions.<br><br>**Misunderstanding Path Definition**: Remember that the path can start and end at any node, and it can include both subtrees of a node. Don't limit your calculations to just left or right subtrees; consider paths that pass through the current node.<br><br>- **Incorrectly Updating Global Maximum**: Ensure that you update the global maximum path sum every time you compute a new local maximum path that passes through the current node, which includes contributions from both left and right subtrees.<br>    <br>- **Returning Incorrect Values**: When returning from the recursive function, only return the maximum sum of the path that can be extended to the parent node, not the total maximum path that includes both subtrees. |                | imp to revise          |

(i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | perform a level-order traversal using a queue while keeping track of the current direction (left to right or right to left). By alternating the direction with each level, I can easily collect the node values in the desired order.<br><br>Note: The way we traverse the node of a level is ALWAYS from left to right. Only when these nodes are inserted into the final result list are they reversed. We can alternatively keep changing the value of the boolean value to reverse every alternate levels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                |                        |

Keep track of characters in a set or map, and when a duplicate character is found, move the start pointer rightward until the substring no longer contains duplicates.

If no such window exists, return an empty string.<br><br>[[minimum window substring]]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                |                        |

Then, use a frequency counter (like a HashMap) to count occurrences of each character in the first string and decrease the count for each character in the second string. Finally, verify if all counts are zero; if they are, the strings are anagrams.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                |                        |

For each node, update its `next` pointer to point to the previous node, then move the pointers one step forward (i.e., `previous` becomes `current`, `current` becomes `next`). Continue this until all nodes have been reversed, and at the end, `previous` will be the new head of the reversed list.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                |                        |

Finally, link the remaining part of the non-empty list to the merged list, and return the merged list starting from the dummy node's next pointer.<br><br>4o                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                |                        |

Insert the first element of each array into the heap, and then repeatedly extract the smallest element from the heap, adding it to the merged list and pushing the next element from that array into the heap. Continue until all elements from every array have been added to the merged list, ensuring an optimal O(nlog⁡k)O(n \log k)O(nlogk) time complexity, where nnn is the total number of elements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                |                        |

Finally, adjust `slow.next` to skip the target node, effectively removing it from the list.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                |                        |
| [Reorder List](https://takeuforward.org/data-structure/reorder-list/)<br>The **Reorder List** problem requires rearranging a singly linked list so that the nodes appear in a specific alternating order. Given a linked list L0→L1→L2→⋯→LnL_0 \rightarrow L_1 \rightarrow L_2 \rightarrow \dots \rightarrow L_nL0​→L1​→L2​→⋯→Ln​, we want to reorder it to L0→Ln→L1→Ln−1→L2→Ln−2…L_0 \rightarrow L_n \rightarrow L_1 \rightarrow L_{n-1} \rightarrow L_2 \rightarrow L_{n-2} \dotsL0​→Ln​→L1​→Ln−1​→L2​→Ln−2​…. In other words, we rearrange the list to alternate nodes from the start and end. | To achieve this reordering efficiently, we can break down the solution into three main steps:<br><br>1. **Find the Middle of the List**:<br>    <br>    - Use the **fast and slow pointer technique** to find the middle node of the list. The `slow` pointer moves one step at a time, while the `fast` pointer moves two steps. By the time the `fast` pointer reaches the end, the `slow` pointer will be at the middle.<br>2. **Reverse the Second Half**:<br>    <br>    - Once we have the middle node, separate the list into two halves. Reverse the second half of the list starting from the node after the middle node. This reversal allows us to easily access nodes from the end in the new ordering.<br>3. **Merge the Two Halves**:<br>    <br>    - With two pointers (one starting at the head of the list and the other at the head of the reversed second half), alternately merge nodes from the two halves. This merges the nodes in the order required by the problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                |                        |
