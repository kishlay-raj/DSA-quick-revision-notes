Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of the **Counting Bits** solution using dynamic programming:

### Problem Recap:

You want to count the number of 1 bits (or set bits) in the binary representation of each number from 0 to `n`.

### Code Breakdown:

python

Copy code

`def countBits(n):     dp = [0] * (n + 1)`

- **`dp` array**: This array stores the number of 1 bits for each number from 0 to `n`. We initialize it with zeros. The length of the array is `n + 1` because we need to store results for numbers from 0 to `n` (inclusive).

python

Copy code

`for i in range(1, n + 1):     dp[i] = dp[i >> 1] + (i & 1)`

- **Iterating from 1 to `n`**: We calculate the number of 1 bits for each number `i` in this range.
- **`i >> 1`** (or `i // 2`): This shifts the bits of `i` one position to the right, which is the same as dividing `i` by 2. It essentially refers to the previously computed result for `i // 2`. The reason this works is that dividing by 2 shifts out the least significant bit, leaving the rest of the bits unchanged.
- **`i & 1`**: This checks whether the least significant bit of `i` is 1 (i.e., whether `i` is odd). If `i` is odd, we add 1 to the count of 1s; if it's even, we add 0.

So, for each `i`, the number of 1 bits is equal to:

- **The number of 1 bits in `i // 2`** (which is stored in `dp[i >> 1]`)
- Plus 1 if `i` is odd (i.e., `i & 1 == 1`).

### Example:

If `n = 5`, the numbers are `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5`. Here's how the `dp` array gets filled:

- **`dp[0] = 0`** (0 in binary is `0`, has no 1s)
- **`dp[1] = dp[1 >> 1] + (1 & 1)` = dp[0] + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1** (1 in binary is `1`, has 1 one)
- **`dp[2] = dp[2 >> 1] + (2 & 1)` = dp[1] + 0 = 1 + 0 = 1** (2 in binary is `10`, has 1 one)
- **`dp[3] = dp[3 >> 1] + (3 & 1)` = dp[1] + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2** (3 in binary is `11`, has 2 ones)
- **`dp[4] = dp[4 >> 1] + (4 & 1)` = dp[2] + 0 = 1 + 0 = 1** (4 in binary is `100`, has 1 one)
- **`dp[5] = dp[5 >> 1] + (5 & 1)` = dp[2] + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2** (5 in binary is `101`, has 2 ones)

### Final Output:

For `n = 5`, the `dp` array is `[0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2]`.

### Time Complexity:

- **Time complexity**: The loop runs from `1` to `n`, so the time complexity is **O(n)**.
- **Space complexity**: The `dp` array takes **O(n)** space to store the results.
