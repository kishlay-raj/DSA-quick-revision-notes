**How to Identify and Confirm If a Problem Can Be Solved Using Greedy Algorithm**

  

The **Greedy Algorithm** is an approach where we make the **locally optimal choice at each step**, hoping that this will lead to a **globally optimal solution**. Greedy algorithms **do not use backtracking or dynamic programming**, meaning they **do not reconsider previous choices**.

**1️⃣ How to Identify If a Problem Can Be Solved Using Greedy?**

  

✅ **The problem asks for an “optimal” solution (min/max) without requiring all solutions.**

✅ **A locally optimal choice does not affect future decisions negatively.**

✅ **The problem involves sorting, intervals, or priority-based selection.**

✅ **It can be solved using a step-by-step decision-making process.**

✅ **You can prove that a Greedy choice always leads to an optimal solution.**

**2️⃣ How to Confirm That Greedy Works?**

  

Before using a **Greedy algorithm**, check for these properties:

  

**✅ Greedy Choice Property:**

  

👉 You can build an optimal solution by making **locally optimal choices** at each step.

👉 Once a choice is made, it is never reconsidered.

  

**✅ Optimal Substructure:**

  

👉 A problem has **optimal substructure** if the **optimal solution to the whole problem contains the optimal solutions to subproblems**.

👉 This means **solving smaller versions of the problem leads to the global solution**.

  

If both properties **hold**, then a Greedy approach **will work**. Otherwise, **use Dynamic Programming**.

**3️⃣ Common Types of Greedy Problems**

|**Problem Type**|**How to Identify?**|**Approach**|
|---|---|---|
|**Activity Selection / Interval Scheduling**|“Pick maximum non-overlapping activities.”|Sort by **end time**, select earliest finishing intervals.|
|**Huffman Encoding (Compression)**|“Minimize encoding length using frequency.”|Use a **Min Heap** to build an optimal prefix tree.|
|**Job Scheduling with Deadlines**|“Maximize tasks done before deadline.”|Sort by **profit descending**, schedule latest available slot.|
|**Fractional Knapsack**|“Choose items to maximize value but can take fractions.”|Sort by **value/weight ratio**, take highest first.|
|**Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**|“Find a subset of edges that connect all nodes with minimum cost.”|Use **Prim’s or Kruskal’s algorithm**.|
|**Dijkstra’s Algorithm**|“Find shortest path in a graph with non-negative weights.”|Use a **priority queue (Min Heap)**.|
|**Coin Change (Greedy version)**|“Use the least number of coins to make an amount (greedy works if denominations allow).”|Pick the **largest coin possible first**.|
|**Greedy Coloring of Graph**|“Color graph nodes with the fewest colors such that no adjacent nodes have the same color.”|Assign the **smallest available color**.|

**4️⃣ Example 1: Activity Selection (Non-Overlapping Intervals)**

  

**Problem Statement:**

Given n activities with start and end times, **find the maximum number of non-overlapping activities** you can attend.

  

**Identification:**

✅ We need to maximize the number of activities → **Optimization Problem**.

✅ We can pick the earliest finishing activity first, as it leaves more room for future choices → **Greedy Choice Property**.

✅ The problem can be broken into subproblems → **Optimal Substructure**.

  

**Greedy Approach:**

1️⃣ **Sort activities by end time.**

2️⃣ **Iterate and pick the first non-overlapping activity.**

```
def activity_selection(intervals):
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])  # Sort by end time
    last_end = float('-inf')
    count = 0

    for start, end in intervals:
        if start >= last_end:  # Non-overlapping
            count += 1
            last_end = end  # Update last selected end time

    return count
```

✅ **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) (Sorting)

✅ **Why Greedy Works?** We **always pick the activity that allows more future activities**.

**5️⃣ Example 2: Huffman Encoding (Optimal Prefix Codes)**

  

**Problem Statement:**

Given characters and their frequencies, find a prefix-free encoding that minimizes the total encoding length.

  

**Identification:**

✅ We want to minimize the total encoding length → **Optimization Problem**.

✅ We always merge the two smallest frequency characters first → **Greedy Choice Property**.

✅ Once merged, the problem reduces to the same problem but smaller → **Optimal Substructure**.

  

**Greedy Approach:**

1️⃣ **Use a Min Heap to always merge the two smallest elements first.**

2️⃣ **Repeat until all elements are merged into one tree.**

```
import heapq

def huffman_encoding(frequencies):
    heap = [[weight, [char, ""]] for char, weight in frequencies.items()]
    heapq.heapify(heap)

    while len(heap) > 1:
        lo = heapq.heappop(heap)
        hi = heapq.heappop(heap)
        for pair in lo[1:]:
            pair[1] = '0' + pair[1]
        for pair in hi[1:]:
            pair[1] = '1' + pair[1]
        heapq.heappush(heap, [lo[0] + hi[0]] + lo[1:] + hi[1:])

    return sorted(heapq.heappop(heap)[1:], key=lambda p: (len(p[-1]), p))
```

✅ **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) (Heap operations)

✅ **Why Greedy Works?** We **always merge the smallest first to keep tree height minimal**.

**6️⃣ Example 3: Fractional Knapsack**

  

**Problem Statement:**

You have n items with value and weight. Find the **maximum total value** you can carry with a given capacity.

  

**Identification:**

✅ We want to maximize value while keeping weight in check → **Optimization Problem**.

✅ We should take the item with the highest **value/weight** ratio first → **Greedy Choice Property**.

✅ We can take **fractions** of items → **No need for DP (which is for 0/1 knapsack)**.

  

**Greedy Approach:**

1️⃣ **Sort items by value/weight ratio.**

2️⃣ **Take the highest ratio first until capacity is full.**

```
def fractional_knapsack(items, capacity):
    items.sort(key=lambda x: x[1] / x[0], reverse=True)  # Sort by value/weight ratio
    total_value = 0

    for weight, value in items:
        if capacity >= weight:
            total_value += value
            capacity -= weight
        else:
            total_value += value * (capacity / weight)  # Take fraction
            break

    return total_value
```

✅ **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) (Sorting)

✅ **Why Greedy Works?** **Taking the highest value/weight ratio first always leads to the best result**.

**7️⃣ When NOT to Use Greedy?**

  

🚫 **If the problem requires reconsidering past choices (Backtracking or DP is better).**

🚫 **If the problem does NOT have Greedy Choice Property or Optimal Substructure.**

🚫 **If a locally optimal choice leads to a globally suboptimal solution.**

  

Example: **0/1 Knapsack (DP is better than Greedy)**

• Here, **Greedy fails** because taking the item with the best ratio first does NOT always lead to the optimal solution.

• **Instead, use Dynamic Programming (Subset-based approach).**

**8️⃣ Final Checklist: Is It a Greedy Problem?**

  

✅ **Does the problem ask for an optimal solution (min/max)?**

✅ **Can we always make a local choice that leads to a global solution?**

✅ **Does the problem exhibit optimal substructure?**

✅ **Can we prove that a Greedy approach gives the best answer?**

  

If **YES**, then Greedy is the correct approach! 🚀
