**How to Identify Bitmask DP**

Bitmask DP is a **subset-based** dynamic programming approach used for problems where the **state of multiple elements** (on/off, visited/unvisited, selected/not selected) needs to be efficiently represented. It is commonly used when dealing with **subset optimization problems** like **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), Set Cover, and Combinatorial Problems**.

**üìå Key Identifiers of Bitmask DP Problems**

  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **The problem involves choosing subsets of elements.**

‚Ä¢ The state represents a **set of choices** (e.g., visited cities, selected items).

‚Ä¢ Example: **‚ÄúFind the shortest path visiting all nodes exactly once.‚Äù** (TSP).

‚Ä¢ Example: **‚ÄúFind the number of ways to assign tasks to workers.‚Äù**

  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Constraints indicate a small N (typically N ‚â§ 20).**

‚Ä¢ Since 2^N grows exponentially, Bitmask DP is feasible **only for small values of N** (usually N ‚â§ 20-25).

‚Ä¢ If N > 30, standard DP or greedy methods are preferred.

  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **A subset or state can be represented using a binary mask (bitmask).**

‚Ä¢ Instead of maintaining a list or array, the **state** is encoded in a **single integer** (0 or 1 for each element).

‚Ä¢ **Example:**

‚Ä¢ For N = 4, a subset {A, C} is represented as **0101 (binary) = 5 (decimal)**.

‚Ä¢ Each **bit in an integer** (0 or 1) represents whether an element is included.

  

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Transitions involve adding/removing elements from the state.**

‚Ä¢ You add/remove elements by setting or clearing bits in the mask.

‚Ä¢ Example: If mask = 0101 (subset {A, C}), adding B gives mask = 0111 (subset {A, B, C}).

‚Ä¢ This is done using **bitwise operations**:

‚Ä¢ **Add element x to mask** ‚Üí mask | (1 << x)

‚Ä¢ **Remove element x from mask** ‚Üí mask & ~(1 << x)

‚Ä¢ **Check if x is in mask** ‚Üí (mask & (1 << x)) != 0

  

5Ô∏è‚É£ **DP state depends only on the bitmask and an index.**

‚Ä¢ **Common DP state format:**

```
dp[mask][i] = best answer for subset `mask` ending at `i`
```

  

‚Ä¢ The mask represents the subset of elements already considered.
