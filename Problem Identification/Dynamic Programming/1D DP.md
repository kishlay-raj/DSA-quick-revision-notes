**How to Identify 1D Dynamic Programming (DP) Problems 🚀**

**1D DP problems** involve **optimizing a sequence of decisions** where the solution depends **only on a single parameter (index, sum, state, etc.)**.

These problems often require finding **maximum/minimum, counting ways, or determining feasibility**.

**📌 Key Identifiers for 1D DP Problems**

  

1️⃣ **The problem involves a single sequence (array, string, or number range)**

• Examples: Given an **array of numbers**, determine the **max sum, min cost, or number of ways** to do something.

  

2️⃣ **The solution depends only on previous elements (linear dependency)**

• dp[i] depends only on dp[i-1], dp[i-2], etc.

• Example: Fibonacci (dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]).

  

3️⃣ **Brute force has overlapping subproblems**

• Recursion gives **TLE (O(2ⁿ))** due to repeated calculations.

• Example: Computing Fibonacci recursively has redundant calculations.

  

4️⃣ **Decision-based problems (Choose/Not Choose, Take/Skip, Divide/Use)**

• Example: Choose elements for **max sum** (House Robber problem).

  

5️⃣ **Count-based problems (Ways to reach a state)**

• Example: Count **ways to reach Nth step** (Climbing Stairs).

**🎯 Common Types of 1D DP Problems**

  

**1️⃣ Fibonacci-Type (Linear DP)**

• **Problem Statement:** Find the nth term of a recurrence relation.

• **Key Clue:** Each term depends on the previous one or two.

• **Examples:**

• Fibonacci Series → dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]

• Climbing Stairs → dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]

• Tiling Problems (Ways to tile 2×N floor)

  

**🛠️ Approach:**

• dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]

• **Space Optimization:** Since only dp[i-1] and dp[i-2] are used, store only **two variables**.

**2️⃣ Subset Sum / Knapsack-Type**

• **Problem Statement:** Determine if a **subset** satisfies a given condition.

• **Key Clue:** “Can we reach X using elements from the array?”.

• **Examples:**

• **Subset Sum Problem** (Can we get sum X?)

• **Partition Equal Subset Sum** (Can we split array into two equal halves?)

• **Coin Change (Minimum/Maximum Coins)**

  

**🛠️ Approach:**

• Define dp[i] as **whether sum i is possible**.

• Recurrence:

• If arr[j] is included: dp[i] = dp[i - arr[j]]

• If arr[j] is NOT included: dp[i] = dp[i]

• **Space Optimization:** Convert O(N*M) DP to O(M) using **1D DP array**.

**3️⃣ House Robber / Maximum Sum Non-Adjacent**

• **Problem Statement:** Pick numbers from an array without picking adjacent elements.

• **Key Clue:** “Can’t take adjacent elements” → **Skip/Take Decision**.

• **Examples:**

• **House Robber** (Max sum by robbing non-adjacent houses)

• **Max Sum Non-Adjacent Elements**

• **Alternating Selections in Arrays**

  

**🛠️ Approach:**

• Define dp[i] as **max sum possible up to index i**.

• Recurrence:

• If **skip**: dp[i] = dp[i-1]

• If **take**: dp[i] = arr[i] + dp[i-2]

• Final formula: dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], arr[i] + dp[i-2])

• **Space Optimization:** Store only dp[i-1] and dp[i-2] in variables.

**4️⃣ Jump Game / Minimum Steps**

• **Problem Statement:** Find the **minimum steps** or **check if we can reach the end**.

• **Key Clue:** “Can we reach the last index?” or “Minimum steps to reach an index.”

• **Examples:**

• **Jump Game I** (Can reach last index?)

• **Jump Game II** (Min jumps to last index)

• **Min Cost Climbing Stairs**

  

**🛠️ Approach:**

• dp[i] = **min steps needed to reach i**

• Transition depends on allowed jumps:

• dp[i] = min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]) + cost[i]

• **Space Optimization:** Use two variables instead of O(N) array.

**5️⃣ Coin Change / Ways to Form a Value**

• **Problem Statement:** Given a set of **coins**, find **ways** or **minimum coins** to make a given sum.

• **Key Clue:** “How many ways to form a sum?” or “Min coins to form X.”

• **Examples:**

• **Coin Change (Minimum Coins)**

• **Coin Change (Number of Ways)**

• **Ways to Make Change**

  

**🛠️ Approach:**

• dp[i] = **min coins required to make i**.

• dp[i] = min(dp[i - coin] + 1) for all coins.

• **Space Optimization:** Convert O(N*M) DP table to **1D DP array**.

**💡 How to Approach 1D DP Problems?**

  

1️⃣ **Identify if it’s DP** → Does it involve choices based on previous values?

2️⃣ **Define dp[i] clearly** → What does dp[i] represent?

3️⃣ **Find the recurrence relation** → How does dp[i] depend on dp[i-1], dp[i-2]?

4️⃣ **Optimize space** → Can you store only last 1-2 values instead of a full array?
