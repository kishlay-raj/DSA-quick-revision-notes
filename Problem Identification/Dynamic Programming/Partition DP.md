**How to Identify Partition DP**

Partition DP is used in problems where **a sequence (array, string, or list) needs to be split into multiple segments, and the goal is to minimize or maximize some cost/function associated with these partitions**. The key idea is to **divide a sequence at certain points and compute the optimal result using dynamic programming**.

**📌 Key Identifiers of Partition DP Problems**

  

1️⃣ **The problem requires splitting an array or string into partitions.**

• Example: **“Partition an array into K parts to minimize/maximize a cost function.”**

• Example: **“Divide a string into palindromes with minimum cuts.”**

  

2️⃣ **The problem asks for an optimal way to divide a sequence.**

• Keywords: **“minimum cuts,” “minimum partitions,” “optimal way to divide,” “grouping,” “segmentation.”**

  

3️⃣ **The recurrence relation involves choosing a partition index k between l and r.**

• **Common Recurrence Format:**

• This means the result for dp[l][r] **depends on previous partitions**.

  

4️⃣ **The problem often has a constraint like K partitions.**

• Example: **“Divide an array into K partitions to minimize the largest sum.”**

• Example: **“Divide a string into at most K palindromic substrings.”**

  

5️⃣ **The DP state is defined as dp[i][j], where:**

• dp[i][j] represents **the best answer for the subproblem from i to j**.

• Sometimes, a **third dimension dp[i][j][k] is used** when we need exactly K partitions.

**🎯 Common Types of Partition DP Problems**

**1️⃣ Palindrome Partitioning (Min Cuts)**

  

**🔹 Problem Statement:** “Find the minimum cuts to partition a string into palindromes.”

📌 **Common Problems:**

• **Palindrome Partitioning**

• **Min Cuts for Palindrome Substrings**

  

**🛠️ Approach:**

• **State:** dp[l][r] → Minimum cuts to partition substring s[l:r] into palindromes.

• **Recurrence Relation:**

• **Time Complexity:** O(N²).

**2️⃣ Partition Array for Maximum Sum**

  

**🔹 Problem Statement:** “Partition an array into contiguous subarrays of at most K length, maximizing the sum.”

📌 **Common Problems:**

• **Partition Array for Maximum Sum (Leetcode 1043)**

  

**🛠️ Approach:**

• **State:** dp[i] → Maximum sum obtainable by partitioning the first i elements.

• **Recurrence Relation:**

• **Time Complexity:** O(NK).

**3️⃣ Painting the Fence / Divide Work Among K Workers**

  

**🔹 Problem Statement:** “Given N items and K workers, distribute items to minimize the maximum workload.”

📌 **Common Problems:**

• **Split Array Largest Sum (Leetcode 410)**

• **Painter’s Partition Problem**

  

**🛠️ Approach:**

• **State:** dp[i][k] → Minimum largest sum when partitioning i elements into k subarrays.

• **Recurrence Relation:**

• **Time Complexity:** O(N²K), can be optimized to O(N log(sum(A))) using binary search.

**4️⃣ K Palindrome Partitioning**

  

**🔹 Problem Statement:** “Partition a string into at most K palindromic substrings to minimize operations.”

📌 **Common Problems:**

• **Minimum Operations to Convert String into K Palindromes**

  

**🛠️ Approach:**

• **State:** dp[i][k] → Minimum cost to partition first i characters into k palindromic substrings.

• **Recurrence Relation:**

• **Time Complexity:** O(N²K).

**💡 How to Approach Partition DP Problems?**

  

1️⃣ **Identify if DP is needed** → Does the problem involve **dividing a sequence optimally**?

2️⃣ **Define dp[i][j] or dp[i][k]** → What does dp[i][j] represent?

3️⃣ **Find the recurrence relation** → How does dp[i][j] depend on previous partitions?

4️⃣ **Use a nested loop to iterate over partitions** → Usually O(N²K).

5️⃣ **Optimize if possible** → Some problems can be optimized with **binary search or greedy**.
