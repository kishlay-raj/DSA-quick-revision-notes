**How to Identify 2D Dynamic Programming (Grid-Based Problems)**

**📌 Key Identifiers of 2D DP Problems**

  

1️⃣ **The problem involves a 2D structure (Grid, Matrix, or Two Strings)**

• **Example:** Given a **grid (NxM)** or two **strings**, find the **minimum/maximum path, number of ways, or optimal transformation**.

  

2️⃣ **The state depends on two parameters (i, j)**

• **Example:** dp[i][j] stores the result for a subproblem considering the first i rows and j columns.

  

3️⃣ **You need to find an optimal solution in a step-by-step manner**

• **Example:** Finding the **minimum cost path** from (0,0) to (N-1,M-1).

  

4️⃣ **Overlapping Subproblems Exist (Recursive Approach Fails Due to Redundant Computation)**

• Brute force (DFS + Recursion) leads to **O(2^(N*M))** complexity → Needs DP to optimize.

  

5️⃣ **The problem involves moving in multiple directions within a grid**

• **Example:** You can move **down, right, diagonal, etc.** from each cell.

**🎯 Common Types of 2D DP Problems**

**1️⃣ Grid-Based Pathfinding Problems**

  

**🔹 Problem Statement:** Find the **minimum, maximum, or number of ways** to move from one point in a **grid** to another.

📌 **Common Problems:**

• **Minimum Path Sum** (Find the path with the smallest sum)

• **Unique Paths (Robot Moving in Grid)** (Count ways to reach the bottom-right)

• **Obstacle Grid (Paths with Blockers)**

  

**🛠️ Approach:**

• **Define dp[i][j]** → Represents the **minimum/max path sum** or **ways to reach (i, j)**.

• **Recurrence Relation:**

• **Minimum Path Sum:**

• **Unique Paths:**

• **Time Complexity:** O(N*M), **Space Optimization** possible (O(M) using a single row).

**2️⃣ Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) Type**

  

**🔹 Problem Statement:** Find the **longest common subsequence** between two strings.

📌 **Common Problems:**

• **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**

• **Longest Common Substring**

• **Edit Distance (Minimum Insertions/Deletions to Convert Strings)**

• **Shortest Common Supersequence**

  

**🛠️ Approach:**

• **Define dp[i][j]** → Represents the **LCS of s1[0...i-1] and s2[0...j-1]**.

• **Recurrence Relation:**

• If characters match:

• If they don’t match:

• **Time Complexity:** O(N*M), **Space Optimization** possible (O(M), storing only two rows).

**3️⃣ Edit Distance (Levenshtein Distance)**

  

**🔹 Problem Statement:** Find **minimum operations (Insert, Delete, Replace)** to convert one string to another.

📌 **Common Problems:**

• **Edit Distance**

• **Word Transformation Problems**

  

**🛠️ Approach:**

• **Define dp[i][j]** → Minimum operations required to convert s1[0...i-1] to s2[0...j-1].

• **Recurrence Relation:**

• If characters match:

• If characters don’t match, take **minimum of three operations**:

• **Time Complexity:** O(N*M), **Space Optimization** possible (O(M) storing only previous row).

**4️⃣ Palindromic DP**

  

**🔹 Problem Statement:** Find palindromic subsequences or substrings.

📌 **Common Problems:**

• **Longest Palindromic Subsequence**

• **Longest Palindromic Substring**

• **Palindrome Partitioning (Min Cuts for Palindromic Segments)**

  

**🛠️ Approach:**

• **Define dp[i][j]** → Represents whether s[i...j] is a palindrome.

• **Recurrence Relation:**

• If s[i] == s[j] and dp[i+1][j-1] is true, then dp[i][j] = true.

• **Time Complexity:** O(N²), **Space Optimization** is difficult due to diagonal dependency.

**5️⃣ Matrix Chain Multiplication (MCM) Type**

  

**🔹 Problem Statement:** Find the **best way to split** or **group elements** for optimal results.

📌 **Common Problems:**

• **Matrix Chain Multiplication** (Find minimum cost to multiply matrices)

• **Burst Balloons** (Optimal way to burst balloons to maximize score)

• **Boolean Parenthesization**

  

**🛠️ Approach:**

• **Define dp[i][j]** → Represents the **minimum cost / best score** from i to j.

• **Recurrence Relation:**

• Try every possible partition k:

• **Time Complexity:** O(N³), **Space Optimization** is hard due to O(N²) table.

**💡 How to Approach 2D DP Problems?**

  

1️⃣ **Identify if DP is needed** → Does the problem involve **multiple states (i, j)**?

2️⃣ **Define dp[i][j] clearly** → What does dp[i][j] represent?

3️⃣ **Find the recurrence relation** → How does dp[i][j] depend on previous states?

4️⃣ **Optimize space if possible** → Can you store only the last row instead of the full DP table?
