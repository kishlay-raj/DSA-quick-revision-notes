**How to Identify DP on Intervals**

**Interval DP** problems involve **optimizing over subarrays, substrings, or segments** while making **decisions on merging, splitting, or partitioning** intervals. The key idea is to compute results **for smaller intervals first** and use them to build solutions for larger intervals.

**📌 Key Identifiers of DP on Intervals**

  

1️⃣ **The problem involves subarrays, substrings, or segments.**

• Example: **“Find the minimum cost of merging N stones.”**

• Example: **“Find the minimum cost to cut a stick into segments.”**

  

2️⃣ **The problem involves merging, splitting, or removing elements from an interval.**

• Example: **“Merge adjacent segments to minimize/maximize cost.”**

• Example: **“Find the optimal way to remove brackets in an expression.”**

  

3️⃣ **The order of operations matters.**

• The problem typically involves **recursive decision-making**, where the **order of merging, splitting, or partitioning affects the result**.

  

4️⃣ **Brute force approaches lead to overlapping subproblems.**

• If trying **all possible partitions results in duplicate calculations**, DP is a strong candidate for optimization.

  

5️⃣ **The state is usually defined by dp[l][r], where l and r represent the interval boundaries.**

• dp[l][r] → The optimal answer (min/max cost, max value, etc.) for the subinterval [l, r].

• The transition generally **splits the interval into two smaller intervals** or **merges them**.

  

6️⃣ **The recurrence relation typically involves a partition index k between l and r.**

• Many interval DP problems **split an interval at some k and compute the result recursively**:

**💡 How to Approach Interval DP Problems?**

  

1️⃣ **Identify if DP is needed** → Does the problem involve **subarrays, substrings, or segments**?

2️⃣ **Define dp[l][r]** → What does dp[l][r] represent?

3️⃣ **Find the recurrence relation** → How does dp[l][r] depend on dp[l][k] and dp[k+1][r]?

4️⃣ **Use a nested loop to iterate over intervals** → Usually O(N³).

5️⃣ **Optimize if possible** → Some problems can be optimized to O(N²).
