**How to Identify If a Problem Can Be Solved by Sliding Window or Two Pointers?**

  

Sliding Window and Two Pointer techniques are useful for **efficiently solving problems that involve arrays or strings**. They help reduce the time complexity of brute-force solutions from **O(n²) to O(n) or O(log n)**.

**1️⃣ When to Use the Two Pointer Technique?**

  

✅ **The problem involves a sorted array or can be sorted**.

✅ **You need to find pairs or triplets** (e.g., two sum, three sum).

✅ **The problem involves partitioning or merging arrays**.

✅ **Requires modifying the array in-place** (e.g., remove duplicates, reverse array).

✅ **You need to shrink or expand a range efficiently** (e.g., binary search on answer).

**2️⃣ Common Two Pointer Problems**

|**Problem Type**|**How to Identify?**|**Approach**|
|---|---|---|
|**Two Sum (Sorted Array)**|“Find two numbers that sum to target in a sorted array.”|Use **left & right pointers**, move accordingly.|
|**Three Sum / Four Sum**|“Find triplets that sum to a given target.”|Sort + Two Pointer search inside loop.|
|**Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array**|“Modify the array in-place to remove duplicates.”|Use **slow and fast pointers**.|
|**Find Intersection of Two Sorted Arrays**|“Find common elements between two sorted lists.”|Move **two pointers** across arrays.|
|**Trapping Rain Water**|“Find water trapped between bars.”|Use **left & right pointers**, track min height.|

**3️⃣ Example: Two Sum (Sorted)**

```
def two_sum_sorted(nums, target):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while left < right:
        curr_sum = nums[left] + nums[right]
        if curr_sum == target:
            return [left, right]
        elif curr_sum < target:
            left += 1  # Increase sum
        else:
            right -= 1  # Decrease sum
    return []
```

✅ **Use when:** Finding pairs that sum to a target in a sorted array.

**4️⃣ Example: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array**

```
def remove_duplicates(nums):
    if not nums: return 0
    slow = 0  # Pointer for unique elements
    for fast in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[fast] != nums[slow]:  # Found new unique element
            slow += 1
            nums[slow] = nums[fast]
    return slow + 1  # New length of array
```

✅ **Use when:** Removing duplicates **in-place** from a sorted array.

**5️⃣ When to Use Sliding Window?**

  

✅ **The problem involves a subarray, substring, or continuous range**.

✅ **You need to optimize searching for the “longest” or “smallest” subarray**.

✅ **The problem involves a constraint that slides over a dataset**.

✅ **Finding subarrays with a given sum or property**.

✅ **You need to track the frequency of elements in a window** (e.g., anagrams).

**6️⃣ Common Sliding Window Problems**

|**Problem Type**|**How to Identify?**|**Approach**|
|---|---|---|
|**Find Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**|“Find longest substring with unique characters.”|Use a **moving window with a set/map**.|
|**Find Smallest Subarray with Sum >= Target**|“Find minimum length subarray that sums to target.”|**Shrink window from left** when condition met.|
|**Find Anagrams in a String**|“Find all occurrences of a permutation of p in s.”|**Track character frequency in a fixed-size window**.|
|**Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K**|“Find the maximum sum of a subarray of length k.”|**Fixed-size window, track running sum**.|
|**Longest Repeating Character Replacement**|“Modify at most k characters to get longest repeating substring.”|**Sliding window + frequency count**.|

**7️⃣ Example: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**

```
def length_of_longest_substring(s):
    char_index = {}
    left = 0
    max_length = 0
    
    for right in range(len(s)):
        if s[right] in char_index:
            left = max(left, char_index[s[right]] + 1)  # Shrink window
        char_index[s[right]] = right
        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)

    return max_length
```

✅ **Use when:** Finding the longest unique substring in O(n).

**8️⃣ Example: Minimum Window Substring (Hard)**

```
from collections import Counter

def min_window(s, t):
    if not t or not s:
        return ""
    
    t_count = Counter(t)
    window_count = {}
    left, right = 0, 0
    have, need = 0, len(t_count)
    min_len, res = float("inf"), ""

    while right < len(s):
        char = s[right]
        window_count[char] = window_count.get(char, 0) + 1
        if char in t_count and window_count[char] == t_count[char]:
            have += 1

        while have == need:
            if right - left + 1 < min_len:
                min_len, res = right - left + 1, s[left:right+1]
            
            window_count[s[left]] -= 1
            if s[left] in t_count and window_count[s[left]] < t_count[s[left]]:
                have -= 1
            left += 1  # Shrink window

        right += 1  # Expand window

    return res
```

✅ **Use when:** Finding **minimum substring that contains all target characters**.

**9️⃣ Sliding Window vs Two Pointers: When to Use Which?**

|**Feature**|**Sliding Window**|**Two Pointers**|
|---|---|---|
|**Best for**|Finding **subarrays or substrings**|Finding **pairs or merging**|
|**Expands & shrinks dynamically**|✅ Yes|❌ No|
|**Sorted input required?**|❌ No|✅ Yes (for binary search)|
|**Use when**|**“Longest”, “Shortest”, “At most K”, “Exactly K”**|**“Two numbers add up to target”**|
|**Example Problems**|Longest substring, Anagrams, Min subarray|Two Sum, Three Sum, Merge Intervals|

**🔟 When to Combine Sliding Window & Two Pointers?**

  

✅ **You need to find a variable-length subarray with constraints**

✅ **The problem has two dynamic pointers moving through the array**

✅ **When optimizing a brute-force O(n²) solution to O(n)**

  

Example: **Find the longest substring with at most k distinct characters**

• Use a **sliding window to expand**, but **shrink it with two pointers** when the constraint is violated.

```
def longest_substring_k_distinct(s, k):
    char_count = {}
    left = 0
    max_length = 0

    for right in range(len(s)):
        char_count[s[right]] = char_count.get(s[right], 0) + 1

        while len(char_count) > k:
            char_count[s[left]] -= 1
            if char_count[s[left]] == 0:
                del char_count[s[left]]
            left += 1  # Shrink window

        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)

    return max_length
```

✅ **Use when:** Finding the **longest substring that meets a constraint**.
