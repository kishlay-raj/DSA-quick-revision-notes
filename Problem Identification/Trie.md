**How to Identify If a Coding Problem Can Be Solved Using a Trie (Prefix Tree)**

  

A **Trie** (pronounced ‚Äútry‚Äù) is a **tree-like data structure** used for **storing and searching strings efficiently**. It is most commonly used when the problem involves **prefix-based operations**.

**1Ô∏è‚É£ How to Identify If a Problem Can Be Solved Using a Trie?**

  

‚úÖ **The problem involves storing a large number of words, prefixes, or substrings efficiently.**

‚úÖ **You need to check if a string or prefix exists in a given dataset efficiently.**

‚úÖ **The problem involves autocomplete, spell checking, dictionary lookups, or word suggestions.**

‚úÖ **The problem involves finding common prefixes between multiple strings.**

‚úÖ **You need to count the occurrences of words with a given prefix.**

‚úÖ **You need to find the longest word that can be built letter by letter from a given list.**

‚úÖ **The problem asks for substring searches, where a Trie can optimize the lookups.**

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Common Problem Patterns & When to Use a Trie**

|**Problem Type**|**How to Identify?**|**Approach**|
|---|---|---|
|**Prefix-based searches (Autocomplete, Dictionary, Spell Checker)**|‚ÄúFind all words starting with a given prefix.‚Äù|Use a Trie for **O(P) lookup**, where **P** is the prefix length.|
|**Word Search in a Large Dictionary**|‚ÄúCheck if a word exists in a list efficiently.‚Äù|Store words in a Trie, then search in **O(L)** time (**L** = word length).|
|**Longest Word in Dictionary**|‚ÄúFind the longest word where each prefix is also in the dictionary.‚Äù|Insert all words into a Trie and traverse to check conditions.|
|**Count Words with a Given Prefix**|‚ÄúFind how many words start with a prefix.‚Äù|Store prefix counts in Trie nodes.|
|**Find the Shortest Unique Prefix for Words**|‚ÄúFind the minimum prefix needed to uniquely identify each word.‚Äù|Store words in a Trie and track first unique branching.|
|**Word Search in a 2D Grid (Boggle-like problems)**|‚ÄúFind all words that can be formed in a character grid.‚Äù|Use **Trie + DFS (Backtracking)** to efficiently search valid words.|
|**IP Routing (Longest Prefix Match)**|‚ÄúFind the longest matching prefix for an IP address.‚Äù|Store IP prefixes in a Trie for fast routing lookups.|
|**DNA/Genome Sequencing Matching**|‚ÄúMatch DNA sequences efficiently.‚Äù|Store sequences in a Trie and search for fast pattern matching.|
|**Data Compression (Radix Tree/Patricia Trie)**|‚ÄúEfficiently compress data with common prefixes.‚Äù|Store common prefixes to reduce memory usage.|

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Example 1: Implement a Trie (Insert, Search, StartsWith)**

  

**Problem Statement:**

Design a Trie that supports the following operations:

‚Ä¢ insert(word): Inserts word into the Trie.

‚Ä¢ search(word): Returns True if word is in the Trie.

‚Ä¢ startsWith(prefix): Returns True if any word in the Trie starts with prefix.

  

**Identification:**

  

‚úÖ The problem involves **prefix-based searching** ‚Üí **Use a Trie**

‚úÖ The problem requires **fast lookups for words and prefixes**

  

**Solution:**

```
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}  # Dictionary to store child nodes (Trie structure)
        self.is_end_of_word = False  # Marks the end of a word

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()

    def insert(self, word):
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            if char not in node.children:
                node.children[char] = TrieNode()
            node = node.children[char]
        node.is_end_of_word = True  # Mark the last character as the end of a word

    def search(self, word):
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            if char not in node.children:
                return False  # Word not found
            node = node.children[char]
        return node.is_end_of_word  # Return True only if it's a complete word

    def startsWith(self, prefix):
        node = self.root
        for char in prefix:
            if char not in node.children:
                return False  # Prefix not found
            node = node.children[char]
        return True  # Prefix exists
```

‚úÖ **Time Complexity:**

‚Ä¢ Insert: **O(L)** (L = word length)

‚Ä¢ Search: **O(L)**

‚Ä¢ StartsWith: **O(P)** (P = prefix length)

**4Ô∏è‚É£ Example 2: Word Search in a 2D Grid (Trie + Backtracking)**

  

**Problem Statement:**

Given a m x n board of characters and a list of words, find all words that can be formed by connecting adjacent letters (horizontally or vertically).

  

**Identification:**

  

‚úÖ The problem involves **searching multiple words efficiently** ‚Üí **Use a Trie**

‚úÖ The problem requires **prefix pruning to avoid unnecessary searches**

‚úÖ The problem involves **backtracking (DFS traversal of the grid)**

  

**Solution:**

```
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.word = None  # Stores complete word at the end of a path

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()

    def insert(self, word):
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            if char not in node.children:
                node.children[char] = TrieNode()
            node = node.children[char]
        node.word = word  # Store word at the end

def findWords(board, words):
    trie = Trie()
    for word in words:
        trie.insert(word)

    rows, cols = len(board), len(board[0])
    result = set()
    
    def dfs(node, r, c):
        if node.word:
            result.add(node.word)  # Found a word
            node.word = None  # Avoid duplicate entries
        
        if r < 0 or c < 0 or r >= rows or c >= cols or board[r][c] not in node.children:
            return
        
        char = board[r][c]
        board[r][c] = "#"  # Mark visited
        for dr, dc in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:  # Move in 4 directions
            dfs(node.children[char], r + dr, c + dc)
        board[r][c] = char  # Reset after recursion

    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if board[r][c] in trie.root.children:
                dfs(trie.root, r, c)

    return list(result)
```

‚úÖ **Time Complexity:** Much faster than brute force **O(M * 4^L)**

‚úÖ **Why It Works?** Trie allows **prefix pruning**, avoiding unnecessary DFS searches.

**5Ô∏è‚É£ When NOT to Use a Trie?**

  

üö´ **If the problem doesn‚Äôt involve prefix-based lookups.**

üö´ **If the dataset is small, a hash table might be faster.**

üö´ **If memory usage is a concern (Tries take up more space than hash maps).**

üö´ **If the problem involves unordered data (hash maps or sets are better for quick lookups).**

  

Example: **Finding an exact word in an unordered list**

‚Ä¢ **Use a hash set instead of a Trie** for **O(1) lookup**.

**6Ô∏è‚É£ Final Checklist: Is It a Trie Problem?**

  

‚úÖ **Does the problem involve prefix-based lookups?**

‚úÖ **Does it require efficient word searches (dictionary, autocomplete, spell check, etc.)?**

‚úÖ **Does the problem require finding words efficiently in a large dataset?**

‚úÖ **Does the problem mention finding the longest common prefix or shortest unique prefix?**

‚úÖ **Does the problem involve backtracking word searches in a 2D grid?**

  

If **YES**, then **Trie is the right approach!** üöÄ
